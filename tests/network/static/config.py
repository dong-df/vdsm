"""
This module creates vdsm configuration from a default vdsm configuration file
under /etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf. It reads conf files from drop-in dirs and updates
the configuration according to the files.

The semantics of the directories and the search order is as follows:

- /etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf - for user configuration. We install this
  file if missing, and never touch this file during upgrade.
- /etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf.d/ - for admin drop-in conf files.
- /usr/lib/vdsm/vdsm.conf.d/ - for vendor drop-in configuration files.
- /run/vdsm/vdsm.conf.d/ - for admin temporary configuration.

Files with a .conf suffix can be placed into any of the vdsm.conf.d drop-in
directories.

The priority of the configuration files is determined by the number prefix of
each file.
